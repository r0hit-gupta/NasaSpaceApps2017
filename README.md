# BNM-Saviour
An app made in IIT Ropar hackathon that helps in sending an SOS alert in case of some emergency or trouble. A live location tracking link is sent to the predefined emergency contacts. A call is also placed using predefined audio message because SMS notifications tend to be missed sometimes by a contact.
